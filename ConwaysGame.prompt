Create a fully functional simulator of Conway's game of life. This simulator should have: a fully functional GUI to display it, the simulation will be played over a grid, a starting menu where you can set up the layout of the blocks in the simulation, the ability to scale all aspects of the GUI by dragging the corner, the ability to save and load different layouts through a menu in the GUI, the ability to quickly end the simulation at any time and return to the starting menu. Make sure to thoroughly think through each step of all your actions before executing.
